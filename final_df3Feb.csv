Incorporated in November 2014 in Singapore, the company is led by a core team with cumulative 30-years’ experience in finance, AI and big data analytics. Backed by institutional investors such as Jungle Ventures and Spring Seeds (a subsidiary of the Singapore Government), the company’s accolades include:  We are among the selected 21 companies which got accreditation from the government of Singapore for their stringent technology, finance and operations due diligence (www.imda.gov.sg/industry-development/programmes-and-grants/startups/accreditation-at-sgd) We won the first place in the MAS FinTech Awards (Singapore SME) in the regulatory compliance space from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for our approach to make the workflows in AML and Reconciliation scalable and highly auditable (beyond ML based black box approach) (www.mas.gov.sg/News-and-Publications/Media-Releases/2016/Ten-FinTech-companies-recognised-for-innovative-solutions-at-inaugural-FinTech-Awards.aspx) We are voted as one of the top 21 AI start-ups focusing on the financial services space by medici (www.letstalkpayments.com/medici-top-21-ai-companies/) We graduated from Nomura's corporate innovation program in November 2017 where we successfully delivered our product – Reconciliation Management Suite – in a pilot environment (https://inc42.com/buzz/nomura-voyager-fintech-accelerator-voyager-demo-day/)  In regulatory compliance, we focus on anti-money laundering and reconciliation and our products – Alerts Management Suite (AMS) and Reconciliation Management Suite (RMS) – cater to these areas, respectively. The mission or goal is to achieve 40% operational efficiency with significant savings in infrastructure and operational costs. Tookitaki's unique selling proposition (USP) is in our approach where we combine our proprietary modelling technique with our complete auditable framework to make the process dynamic and highly explainable (moving out of the black box approach). Moreover, our flexible on-premise and cloud-packaging capabilities, along with the option of easy integration to exiting core-banking applications (REST API end points), make the solution deployment faster with lesser barrier to entry. Today, regulatory compliance processes have become more complex and fluidic, increasing the chances for rule-based models to fail. Banks need to move beyond static rule-based systems and adopt a new approach to prevent financial and reputation loss. Tookitaki bridges the gap with its innovative software products – AMS, RMS and PMS. Role: Data Science Intern The data science team is responsible for solving business problems on complex data. Data complexity could be characterized in terms of volume, dimensionality and multiple touchpoints/sources. We understand the data, ask fundamental-first-principle questions and apply our analytical and machine learning skills to solve the problem in the best way possible. The problems that we tackle are focused on our 2 products/IP related to anti-money laundering (AML) and financial exception management. In addition, the team plays a pivotal role in shaping company IP, primarily in area of approach, model selection, model tuning and feature engineering, so that engineering can take this up and automate the same via a pipeline.  ","Our Ideal Candidate Our Data Science team is looking for a Data Science Intern, who will:  Mine and analyze data from company databases to drive improvement of product development Develop custom data models and algorithms to apply to data sets Develop techniques to make ML algorithms interpretable Coordinate with different functional teams to implement models and monitor outcomes Develop processes to monitor and analyze model performance  Desired technical Requirements  Strong problem-solving skills with an emphasis on product development Experience using statistical computer languages (R, Python) to manipulate data and draw insights from large data sets Experience using pyspark to make use of distributed computing would be a plus Knowledge of a variety of machine learning techniques (clustering, decision tree learning, artificial neural networks, etc.) and their real-world advantages/drawbacks Knowledge of advanced statistical techniques and concepts (regression, properties of distributions, statistical tests, and proper usage, etc.) and experience with applications Excellent written and verbal communication skills for coordinating across teams A drive to learn and master new technologies and techniques  Desired Non-technical Requirements  Very strong communication skills both written and verbal Strong desire to work with start-ups Must be a team player   ",https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/job/intern-ds-tookitaki-holding-c62de4544d46e3e385930e108b6643c1,East,
